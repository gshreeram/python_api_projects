# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to integrate the LanguageTools API into a Python application using REST API calls and JSON as the data interchange format. The LanguageTools API provides a set of language processing and grammar checking functionalities that can be leveraged to improve the quality of text-based content.

## Goals

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- [x] **API Integration:** Develop a Python module to interact with the LanguageTools API. This module should handle authentication, API endpoint requests, and response handling.

- [x] **Text Processing:** Implement functions to preprocess and format the text data before sending it to the LanguageTools API. This may involve tokenization, cleaning, or any necessary transformations.

- [x] **Grammar Checking:** Utilize the LanguageTools API to perform grammar and language checks on the provided text. Parse the API response to extract relevant information such as detected errors, suggested corrections, and grammar suggestions.

- [x] **Error Correction:** Implement logic to apply the suggested corrections received from the LanguageTools API to the original text. Provide options to apply corrections automatically or present them to the user for manual review.

- [] **Integration Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the integration with the LanguageTools API. Ensure that the API calls are properly made, and the responses are correctly processed and interpreted.

- [] **Documentation and Examples:** Create clear and concise documentation for the Python module, including installation instructions, usage examples, and guidelines for customization and extension. Provide sample code snippets to demonstrate how to integrate and utilize the LanguageTools API effectively.

- [x] **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and unexpected API responses. Incorporate logging functionality to track API requests, responses, and any encountered issues for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

By achieving these goals, the project aims to enable Python developers to seamlessly integrate the LanguageTools API into their applications and enhance the language quality of their textual content.
