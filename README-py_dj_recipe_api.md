# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fully functioning REST API using Python, Django, and Django REST Framework. The API will provide a range of functionalities, including:

- [X] User authentication using Custom Model
- [ ] Object creation
- [ ] Filtering and sorting objects
- [ ] Image uploading and viewing

The project will also cover additional aspects such as:

- [X] Testing and linting with TDD and GitHub Actions
- [ ] API documentation using Swagger
- [ ] Deployment on AWS

## Project Goals

The following objectives will be achieved throughout this project:

- [X] Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and authenticate their requests to the API using custom user model.
- [ ] Develop API endpoints to enable users to create objects in the system with proper validation and authorization checks.
- [ ] Design API endpoints that support filtering and sorting of objects based on different criteria.
- [ ] Implement functionality to allow users to upload and view images through the API securely and efficiently.
- [ ] Follow best practices for testing and linting with Test Driven Development (TDD) principles and automate them using GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Generate comprehensive API documentation using Swagger to provide clear guidelines for API usage.
- [ ] Explore deployment options on AWS to ensure scalability and availability of the API.

## Technologies and Tools

The project will utilize the following technologies and tools:

- [X] Python
- [X] Django
- [X] Django REST Framework
- [X] Postgres
- [X] Docker
- [ ] Swagger

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this course, you will have built a fully functioning REST API with the aforementioned functionalities. You will also have gained proficiency in Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Postgres, Docker, and Swagger. Additionally, you will have learned about testing, linting, and API documentation best practices, as well as deployment on AWS. This knowledge will enable you to develop robust and secure REST APIs, following industry-standard practices.
